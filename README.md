#  SDSS Educational Activities using SciServer Notebooks

The notebooks maintained here are intended to be run from the SciServer compute environment:
http://www.sciserver.org/tools/compute/

If you set up a SciServer account and upload these notebooks into a new “container”, they should fire right up.  There are two versions of each of the python notebooks in this repo. One simply has all of the output cleared, and one is fully compiled.  In practice, you should delete some of the cells, leaving them to the students as exercises.
