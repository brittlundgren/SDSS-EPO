    "The following python notebook gives an example of how you can use [SciServer Compute](http://www.sciserver.org/tools/compute/) for your own astronomy research from anywhere with access to the internet. Because of SciServer's unique capabilities, you can access and analyze the vast SDSS dataset in the cloud without downloading anything (including code!) to your local computer.   All you need in order to get started is a web browser!\n",
