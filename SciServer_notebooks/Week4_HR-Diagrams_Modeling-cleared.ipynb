If you already have a favorite cluster, type it into the “name” box in [Navigate](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr13/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx) and click “Resolve” to see if it’s in the SDSS database. If not, you can look at [this catalog](http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=278836.0) of open and globular clusters that have already been found with SDSS data and choose one that you like. When you’ve found an object, type its name into Navigate as just explained, and it will likely appear automatically. Some of the clusters aren’t listed in the SDSS index, however; if that’s the case, each object’s RA and Dec can be found by clicking on its image in the catalog. You can then type the values into Navigate by hand.\n",

    "## Modeling stellar evolution tracks with isochrones\n",
    "\n",
    "An isochrone is a computational model of stellar evolution. Parameters for a cluster like its age and chemical composition are plugged into a formula, and a computer simulates the development of stars within that cluster based upon their mass. The output is similar to the results of your SQL query from the first section of this Expedition: it’s a table of numbers, where each row lists the properties of a given star. That means you can also plot this data just like you did to produce your color-magnitude diagram, and it should look like an HR diagram for a cluster of the properties you selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isochrones are designed to model the internal mechanisms of stars, so we use them to test our understanding of stellar evolution by comparing their results against external (measurable) properties. This is why we don’t plot them on the mass-luminosity axes or using other relationships: we can most easily measure stars’ luminosity and temperature, which makes Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams the most efficient format to place theory alongside observation. We’ll be doing things backwards, though, since we assume that isochrones are more or less correct and use them to learn more about your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When producing an isochrone to match your cluster, the primary variables you need to work with are the metallicity and age. These are two parameters that every isochrone generator should require, although they may offer additional options as well. To simplify the process, feel free to do an online search for your cluster’s metallicity. The result should be a value for Z or [Fe/H], and depending on which one your generator uses, you may need to convert these values. The equation for this is [Fe/H] = log(Z/0.02), using a base-10 logarithm. As for the age, you’ll be finding that for your cluster in the next section of the activity. For now, plug in 200 million (2•10⁸) years; this should offer a relatively long main sequence to compare against.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief online search can bring up several results for isochrone generators, typically hosted on university web domains, so feel free to explore your options before choosing which one to use. We will use the [Dartmouth Isochrone and Luminosity Function Generator 2012](http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/models/index.html). It’s important to note, however, that models of stellar evolution are constantly being developed as we deepen our knowledge of the processes involved and our computing power improves. The generators linked to above may soon obsolesce, so you may want to research if other options have been released recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Dartmouth Generator, create an isochrome model with a combination of the following choices: \n",
